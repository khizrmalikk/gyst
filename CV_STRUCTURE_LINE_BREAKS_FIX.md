## ‚ùå **Problem:**

Email: khizr.malik5@gmail.com | Phone: +447787467244 | Location: London
Detail-oriented and innovative Software Engineer with over 3 years of experience in full-stack
development... [all content running together without proper sections]
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Solidity
- **Web Development**: ReactJS, NextJS, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS
[continues with no section breaks or proper structure]
```

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied:**

### **1. FIXED AI PROMPT STRUCTURE**
Enhanced AI prompt to generate **EXACT** section headers:

```
MANDATORY FORMATTING STRUCTURE:
You MUST use these EXACT section headers (all caps) with double line breaks:

PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

[Summary content here]

KEY SKILLS

[Skills content with bullet points or formatting]

WORK EXPERIENCE

[Work experience entries with proper formatting]

EDUCATION

[Education details]

Each section MUST be separated by double line breaks for proper PDF formatting.
```

### **2. FIXED FALLBACK CV GENERATION**
Updated both fallback functions to use structured headers:

```javascript
// OLD (no structure)
sections.push(`${userProfile.name}\n\n`);
sections.push(summary);

// NEW (proper structure)
sections.push(`PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY\n\n${summary}\n\n`);
sections.push(`KEY SKILLS\n\n${skills}\n\n`);
sections.push(`WORK EXPERIENCE\n\n${workContent}\n\n`);
```

### **3. ENHANCED PDF PARSER**
Improved section header detection:

```javascript
const isSectionHeader = isSection && (
  line === 'PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY' ||
  line === 'KEY SKILLS' ||
  line === 'WORK EXPERIENCE' ||
  line === 'EDUCATION' ||
  line === 'CERTIFICATIONS' ||
  line === 'LANGUAGES' ||
  line === 'PROFESSIONAL LINKS'
);
```

### **4. IMPROVED SECTION FORMATTING**
Enhanced `addSection()` method for better content handling:

```javascript
private addSection(title: string, content: string): void {
  this.currentY += 8;        // Space before section
  this.addText(title, 14, true);  // Bold title
  this.currentY += 6;        // Space after title
  
  // Smart content formatting
  for (const line of lines) {
    if (isJobTitle) {
      this.addText(line, fontSize + 1, true);  // Bold job titles
    } else if (line.startsWith('-') || line.startsWith('‚Ä¢')) {
      this.addText(`  ${line}`, fontSize, false); // Indent bullets
    } else {
      this.addText(line, fontSize, false);
    }
    this.currentY += 2;  // Line spacing
  }
  
  this.currentY += 6;  // Space after section
}
```
