# 📦 Chrome Extension Distribution Guide

This guide covers how to package and distribute your Job Application Bot Chrome extension to users.

## 🚀 Quick Start - Package for Distribution

### Step 1: Update Your Build Script

First, update your production build command in `package.json` with your actual Vercel URL:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_VERCEL_URL with your actual deployment URL
"build:extension:prod": "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://YOUR_VERCEL_URL.vercel.app node scripts/build-extension.js"
```

### Step 2: Build Production Extension

```bash
# Build extension for production
npm run build:extension:prod

# This creates: extension-build/ directory with production-ready files
```

### Step 3: Create Distribution Package

```bash
# Create a zip file for distribution
npm run package:extension

# This creates: job-application-bot-extension.zip
```
