- **Tracking:** Application is saved with comprehensive data

### **Real Data Integration:**

- Verify CV/Cover Letter generation flags are shown

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **Extension Not Loading:**
- Check Chrome DevTools console for errors
- Ensure server is running (`npm run dev`)
- Verify extension permissions are granted

### **Buttons Not Working:**
- Open Chrome DevTools on the side panel
- Check console for JavaScript errors
- Verify API server is responding: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/extension/profile`

### **PDF Generation Issues:**
- Check server console for PDF generation errors
- Verify jspdf dependency is installed
- Test API directly: 
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/extension/generate-cv \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"jobInfo":{"title":"Test","company":"Test"},"userProfile":{"name":"Test"}}' \
    --output test.pdf
  ```

### **Form Filling Not Working:**
- Verify forms are detected (green indicator should appear)
- Check if form fields have proper names/labels
- Test on different job sites (some forms may be complex)

## üîó **Test URLs**

Try these sites for testing:
