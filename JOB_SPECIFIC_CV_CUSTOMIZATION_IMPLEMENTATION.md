# üéØ **JOB-SPECIFIC CV CUSTOMIZATION - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION**

## ‚úÖ **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### **üîç Problems Found:**
1. **Extension using old endpoint** - Called `/api/extension/fill` instead of unified CV generation
2. **Job info not fully utilized** - AI wasn't properly tailoring content to specific jobs  
3. **Weak AI prompts** - Generic prompts didn't emphasize job-specific customization
4. **No job-specific storage** - Generated CVs weren't saved per application in database
5. **Database schema gaps** - Missing fields for job-specific generated content

### **üîß Solutions Applied:**
1. **Fixed Extension Flow** - Now uses unified API with proper job data
2. **Enhanced AI Prompts** - Comprehensive job-tailoring instructions
3. **Database Schema Enhancement** - Added job-specific document storage
4. **Session Tracking** - Tracks generated documents per application
5. **Complete Profile Integration** - Uses full Supabase profile data

```javascript
// Fetched from Supabase database 
userProfile: {
  name: "Your Real Name",
  skills: ["React", "Node.js", "Python", "AWS"], // From DB
  workHistory: [
    {
      title: "Software Engineer",
      company: "Previous Corp",
      duration: "2021 - Present", 
      description: "Led development of...",
      skills: ["React", "Node.js"], // Skills used in this role
      location: "Remote"
    }
  ],
  education: {
    degree: "Bachelor of Computer Science",
    field: "Computer Science", 
    school: "University Name",
    gpa: "3.8"
  },
  certifications: [...],
  languages: [...]
}
```

### **Step 3: AI-Powered Job Tailoring**
```javascript
// Enhanced AI prompt with job-specific instructions
üéØ TARGET JOB ANALYSIS:
- Position: Senior Software Engineer
- Company: TechCorp Inc  
- Job Requirements: React, Node.js, AWS, 5+ years

CUSTOMIZATION FOCUS:
- Tailor ALL content to highlight relevance for Senior Software Engineer role

- Use keywords from job description throughout CV
- Prioritize relevant experience over general experience
- Adapt professional summary to target this specific opportunity

JOB-SPECIFIC TAILORING:
1. Professional Summary: Rewrite to directly address the Senior Software Engineer role at TechCorp Inc
2. Skills Section: Prioritize React, Node.js, AWS - reorganize to show job-relevant skills first  
3. Work Experience: Emphasize achievements with React, Node.js, AWS

5. Relevance Ranking: Present experience in order of relevance to this position
```

### **Step 4: Job-Specific Document Storage**
```sql
-- Enhanced database schema for job-specific storage
CREATE TABLE generated_documents (
    application_id UUID,
    document_type TEXT, -- 'cv' or 'cover_letter'
    job_title TEXT,
    company_name TEXT,
    job_requirements TEXT[],
    content TEXT, -- The actual generated content
    keywords_used TEXT[],
    customization_level TEXT, -- 'heavy', 'moderate', 'basic'
    tailored_for_job BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    generated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üöÄ **Technical Implementation Details**

### **1. Extension Enhancement** ‚úÖ
```javascript
// Fixed CV generation flow
async generateCV() {
  // Get complete job data and user profile
  const jobInfo = this.currentJobData; // Extracted from page
  const userProfile = await fetchCompleteProfile(); // From Supabase
  
  // Generate job-tailored CV
  const response = await fetch('/api/documents/generate-cv', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      jobInfo: {
        title: jobInfo.title,
        company: jobInfo.company,
        requirements: jobInfo.requirements,
        description: jobInfo.description
      },
      userProfile: completeProfile
    })
  });
  
  // Track generated document
  await this.saveGeneratedDocument('cv', {
    filename: `${userName}-${companyName}.pdf`,
    tailoredFor: `${jobTitle} at ${company}`
  });
}
```

### **2. Enhanced AI Prompts** ‚úÖ

```sql
-- Job-specific columns added to job_applications
ALTER TABLE job_applications ADD COLUMN job_specific_cv_content TEXT;
ALTER TABLE job_applications ADD COLUMN cv_tailoring_notes TEXT;
ALTER TABLE job_applications ADD COLUMN tailoring_keywords JSONB;

-- Dedicated generated_documents table
CREATE TABLE generated_documents (
    application_id UUID,
    document_type TEXT,
    tailored_for_job BOOLEAN,
    keywords_used TEXT[],
    customization_level TEXT
);
```
