curl http://localhost:3000/api/test/availability/public

# Check system health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health/public

# Test LLM functionality (only if AI available)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test/llm/public

```

### Optional (Enhanced Features)
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key  # For full AI capabilities
DATABASE_URL=your_db_url           # For persistent storage

## 🚨 OpenAI Quota Issue - RESOLVED!

**Problem**: 429 quota exceeded errors consuming credits unnecessarily
**Solution**: ✅ Smart availability system with credit protection

**Current Behavior**:
- **Pre-Check System**: AI availability checked before making expensive API calls
- **Credit Protection**: No API calls made when quota is exceeded
- **Cached Results**: 5-minute cache prevents repeated availability checks
- **Free Detection**: Uses free `/models` endpoint to check OpenAI status
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear explanation when AI is unavailable
- **Zero Downtime**: Users experience uninterrupted service

## 🎯 What Works in Fallback Mode

When OpenAI is unavailable, the system still provides:
- ✅ Job search query parsing
- ✅ Cover letter generation (template-based)
- ✅ Resume bullet point optimization
- ✅ Job scoring and matching
- ✅ Conversational responses
- ✅ All UI functionality

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. User Experience
- [ ] Test the search page chat interface
- [ ] Try different job search queries
- [ ] Verify application generation works

### 2. OpenAI Setup (Optional)
- [ ] Add billing to OpenAI account for enhanced AI features
- [ ] Test full AI capabilities once credits are added

### 3. Feature Development
- [ ] Add real job board APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed)
